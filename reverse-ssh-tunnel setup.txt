This file outlines how a reverse tunnel could be setup for the cimon-pis.

https://www.micronbot.com/Raspberry-Pi/Pi-autossh.html
https://issues.sbb.ch/browse/MWESERVICE-510112

Requirements:
- a machine with a public IP <public-ip> running ssh and a user <user> with root privileges
- a separate port for each cimon-raspi
- autossh must be installed on the cimon-raspi


Manual start of tunnel on cimon-pi:
$ ssh -N -R<port>:localhost:22 <user>@<public-ip>

Connect to the cimon-pi from a shell on the public server:
$ ssh -p 2222 pi@localhost



Steps needed for automatic installation:
- pass reverse tunnel port for this specific cimon as parameter to the installation (start.sh)
- "apt-get install autossh"
- distribute rsa private and public keys to cimon-pi (using the usb stick, like key.bin, so we do not need to commit them to github)
- create auto-start configuration for auto ssh
- create/extend ~/.ssh/config with necessary parameters (jumpserver + port)
